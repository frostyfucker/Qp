// FIX: Removed a problematic '/// <reference types="next" />' directive that was causing a "Cannot find type definition file" error. This assumes that Next.js types are automatically handled by the build process.

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
